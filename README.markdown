How to use this code
====================
1. Clone this repository
2. Install "leiningen" - (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). Leiningen is a self-contained script. The only dependency you need is Java.
3. run "lein deps" in this directory - to pull the lein-run plugin and  all dependencies will be downloaded automatically.
4. "lein run" will create your indexes (HACK: initially hardcoded to /tmp/2). if it doesnt work, run "lein run nihsearch -main"
